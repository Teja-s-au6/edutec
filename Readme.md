# Components

Frontend is done using React.js and design is simple, we have only one component which will display the results.

Backend is done using Node.js. MVC folder structure is followed, since backend is also small you can find very few files.Controller folder will get the data and send the results.Routes folder will be used for routing. 

## Technology used

- React.js (_Frontend_)
- Node.js (_Backend_)
- Express Js (_Framework for node Js_)
- Axios (_For calling an API_)
- CORS (_To eliminate the CORS Error_)
- Dotenv (_To store environment variables securily_)

## Future

Implement the test libraries like JEST, React Testing library
